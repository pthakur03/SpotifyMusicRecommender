# ML-Based Music Genre Predictor

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning to accurately predict song genres, similar to the technology used by popular music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. Whether it's calm music for studying, energetic tunes for exercising, or music for everyday activities, this tool helps in categorizing and recommending music efficiently. The project was completed in the Spring of 2024 under CS 4641 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Key Features

- **Deep Q Network**: Utilizes reinforcement learning to train a Deep Q Network for genre prediction.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Evaluates song novelty and audio content for accurate classification.
- **Neural Networks with Filtering**: Combines neural networks and advanced filtering techniques for enhanced genre prediction accuracy.

## Background

Music platforms have explored various algorithms to enhance user experience by providing accurate music recommendations. Our project dives into:

- **Deep Q Network**: Training methodologies and application in music genre prediction.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Assessment of song novelty and audio content.
- **Neural Networks**: Integration with filtering techniques for improved results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Libraries for building and training neural networks.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Traditional machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

### Technology Stack

The following technologies were used for the compilation of the project:

- Python 3.6+
